The quick solution to life's most difficult #firstworldproblem

###How familiar is this conversation to you?

“Where do you want to go to eat?”

“I don’t care?”

“How about sushi?”

“No, not that.”

“Okay, how about Mexcian?”

“Nah, not feeling that either.”

“Well, what do you want?”

“I don’t care.”

Nothing ruins relationship bliss like a little indecision. Luckily, there’s a tool that can help with that.

**About This Project**

Personally, I waste an embarrassing amount of time trying to decide what to eat, and beyond that, what's even worth going out to get. I know I'm not unique in this dilemma, so I'm hopeful this app will solve that problems for other people (and their significant others), too.

The first iteration is relatively simple: uses the Yelp API to generate a list of top restaurants in the user's vicinity, finds the restaurant's price level with Google Places API (Yelp doesn't return this information), and then presents a selection of restaurants to the user to choose from. In the future, I'd love to build out more features, such as factoring in desired distance and transportation method, generating a completely new list of restaurants each time the user goes through the platform, or providing photos of the food.

This project is done with pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and is my first foray into the world of coding.
